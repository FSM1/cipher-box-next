# Web client — v2 blueprint

Resolved by [Blueprint: web client](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/45).
Normative for the v2 build. Upstream inputs: the
[component decomposition](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/28)
(D3–D5), the
[sync/refresh/offline](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/33)
design, and the seam contracts and facade law in
[`blueprint/engine.md`](engine.md); the
[feature set](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/5) fixes what
ships. This doc covers the three web-side units of the #28 D3 layout —
`crates/wasm`, `packages/client`, `apps/web`. Where the engine blueprint
already fixes behavior (adoption gate, sync core, rotation, grants, API
client), this doc adds only the browser hosting around it, never a second
copy of it.

## Doctrine

The web client is a **thin shell around the worker-hosted engine**:
`crates/wasm` compiles core + engine to one WASM artifact, `packages/client`
hosts that artifact in a dedicated worker and implements every browser seam,
and `apps/web` renders engine state and forwards intent. Every trust decision
already happened below the facade (engine.md); the UI renders, it never
decides. Key material exists only inside the engine worker's WASM memory —
nothing key-shaped ever crosses the facade, structurally rather than by
discipline. There is exactly **one engine instance per origin** (#28 D4): the
leader tab hosts it; every other tab is a thin mirror.

What dies relative to v1 — with the design that killed it:

| Gone | Killed by |
| --- | --- |
| Zustand `folderTree` mirror, the `children`/`rawChildren` two-plane split, sequence-clock store guards | #33 D6 — snapshot ⊕ pending-op overlay computed in the engine; the UI is a projection with no independent writers |
| Three ad-hoc freshness legs (nav re-resolve, root-only 30 s poll, post-upload refresh) and the `forceResolve` foot-gun | engine sync core + event stream; the UI only emits refresh hints |
| Web-side crypto: ShareDialog ECIES, invite key wrapping, the encrypt Web Worker, download decrypt in services | #28 D1 — TS keeps no engine logic; grants live in metadata |
| Generated `api-client` axios singleton, web-side token injection/refresh | #28 D5 — the engine's hand-written API client owns the token lifecycle |
| Kind resolution maps (`isFileRefResolved`), kind-blind refs, folder-safe defaults | #27 D7 — `kind` is an immutable field of the child ref |
| `'root'` sentinel + `ipnsName` route params and store keys | #27 D9 + #26 D3 — names rotate; routes and identity key on the stable node id |
| Rotation driver, job checkpoints, badge state machine, Web Locks rotation lock | #26 D8 — no job records; tab leadership subsumes the lock |
| The per-depth shared-nav state machine and its manual key zeroization choreography | keys never enter JS; shared scopes are ordinary snapshot state |
| In-memory floor fallback + degraded-cache toast (v1 D-08) | #26 D4 / #39 D4 — FloorStore is required; the cold-seed floor law makes a wiped store staleness, not exposure |
| The decrypt Service Worker as a crypto layer, CTR streaming | chunk-sealed content gives native random access; the SW is demoted to a dumb byte pipe |
| MiniSearch encrypted index, search palette | #5 — client-side search deferred, designed-for |

## Component map

- **`crates/wasm`** — wasm-bindgen bindings over `engine` (which links
  `core`): the facade's commands and event stream, plus the generated TS
  types. No logic of its own.
- **`packages/client`** — everything between the WASM boundary and React:
  engine worker lifecycle, tab leadership, the two facade transports, every
  browser seam implementation (IndexedDB, OPFS, `fetch`), the login handoff,
  and the Service Worker brokerage. It wraps the facade, never extends it
  (engine.md facade law); it holds no vault semantics.
- **`apps/web`** — React 18 + Vite SPA (#28 D7 — the repo's existing web
  toolchain, edited in place): routes, views, dialogs over facade state. No
  crypto, no seams, no tokens, no direct WASM imports — its only vault-facing
  dependency is `packages/client`.

## WASM packaging and the type boundary

- **One artifact**: `crates/wasm` builds a single wasm-bindgen module
  exposing the engine facade (core is linked inside; nothing exports core
  directly to JS). Built as an ES module, dynamically imported inside the
  engine worker; Vite fingerprints and serves it immutable. Single-threaded —
  no wasm threads or SharedArrayBuffer in v2.0; the worker already keeps all
  engine work off the UI thread.
- **Types are generated, not hand-mirrored**: the wasm-bindgen `.d.ts` output
  is the boundary contract; `packages/client` re-exports those types through
  its facade proxy. No hand-maintained TS mirror of engine structures — the
  v1 twin-type drift class has no home to grow in.
- **Boundary hygiene**: IPNS sequence numbers and sizes cross as `bigint`;
  binary payloads cross as transferred `ArrayBuffer`s (UI→worker) or `Blob`
  handles (cross-tab). The WASM KAT run in CI covers the `u64`/BigInt and
  getrandom boundary risks (core.md); `getrandom`'s JS backend wires to
  `crypto.getRandomValues` in the worker scope.
- **Memory hygiene**: key material lives in WASM linear memory inside core's
  `Zeroizing` types. The facade's event/query surface exposes no key bytes by
  construction, so UI-thread JS never holds a key; the login secret is the
  single inbound exception (below).

## Engine hosting and tab leadership

One long-lived engine instance in a dedicated module worker, hosted by the
**leader tab** (#28 D4). Leadership and failover (engineering judgment on the
mechanism; the invariant — one engine writer per origin — is D4's):

- **Election**: every tab's `packages/client` requests an exclusive Web Lock
  (`cipherbox-engine`). The holder is the leader: it spawns the engine worker
  and runs everything — sync ticks, background jobs, the op-queue drain,
  publishes. Web Locks auto-release on tab close, crash, or discard, which is
  exactly the failover primitive needed.
- **Followers are thin mirrors, not engines**: a non-leader tab spawns no
  worker and holds no keys. It renders view projections broadcast by the
  leader and sends commands as data. Both directions ride a
  `BroadcastChannel`: projections and events are plain structured-clone data;
  commands carry at most `Blob`/`File` handles (structured clone shares the
  immutable backing store — no byte copies for uploads).
- **Failover**: the lock releases → some follower acquires it, spawns a fresh
  engine worker, and rehydrates from the durable seams (floors, op queue,
  staged bytes, snapshot cache — all origin-shared). Ops journal durably
  before they are acked to the UI, so failover loses no accepted work;
  commands in flight at the instant of leader death time out and surface a
  retry. A backgrounded leader keeps ticking (worker timers degrade
  gracefully); focused followers' refresh hints ride the broadcast so
  user-visible freshness follows the focused tab, and the leader's focus
  window is the union of all tabs' open folders.
- **The facade is transport-agnostic**: `packages/client` exposes one typed
  async facade; underneath it selects the local transport (UI ↔ own worker
  `postMessage`, transferables allowed) on the leader and the broadcast
  transport on followers. Leadership changes swap the transport without the
  UI noticing.

The RPC protocol is a hand-written, promise-correlated command/response layer
plus the one-way event stream — request ids, no codegen, wasm-bindgen types
end to end. Commands are the engine facade's commands verbatim; the client
adds transport, never semantics.

## Browser seams

The web implementations of the engine's constructor seams (engine.md table),
all living in `packages/client` and running inside the engine worker realm:

| Seam | Web implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **FloorStore** | IndexedDB. Durable across logout by design. No in-memory fallback tier: an unavailable IndexedDB is an unsupported-browser hard error at login, not a degraded mode. Ephemeral storage (private windows) is safe: floors cold-seed from the re-point object's owner-vouched epochs (#39 D4), so a wiped store costs staleness, never a rolled-back revocation boundary |
| **RecordTransport** | `fetch` against the configured `/routing/v1` endpoint set (someguy + at least one public endpoint) |
| **Http** | `fetch` with `credentials: 'include'` on the API origin, so the HTTP-only refresh cookie rides it — which is why web's CredentialStore is a no-op |
| **Mailbox** | The engine's own API client over the Http seam — nothing web-specific |
| **RefreshHintSource** | UI navigation events forwarded through the facade, `visibilitychange` regain, `online` reconnect, cross-tab focus hints from follower tabs |
| **Scheduler** | Worker timers. Background throttling is tolerated: the 30 s tick and the ~hourly re-PUT job both survive coarse timers, and every wake-relevant transition already fires a refresh hint |
| **StagingStore** | Op-queue rows in IndexedDB; staged upload bytes in OPFS (per-op files, sync access handles in the worker), behind the sync-timing-profile budget |
| **SnapshotCache** | IndexedDB, ciphertext-only at rest — cached records/metadata unseal in the engine on read; plaintext never lands in browser storage |
| **CredentialStore** | No-op (see Http) |

## UI state law

- **Rendered state = the engine's word, verbatim** (#33 D6): the facade emits
  snapshot updates with the pending-op overlay already applied plus per-node
  pending/dead-letter flags. The UI holds one mechanically derived
  subscription store (a `useSyncExternalStore` adapter over the event stream)
  with **no independent writers** — the v1 two-store desync class has no
  second store to desync. UI-owned state (selection, dialogs, route) carries
  node ids only.
- **Listings hydrate progressively**: name and kind render instantly from the
  parent's child refs (#27 D7); size/mtime arrive as child resolves land in
  the snapshot — no blocking resolution pass, no kind-flip UX.
- **Routes key on the stable node id** — never `ipnsName` (names rotate under
  write rotation) and no `'root'` sentinel; the root is just the vault
  pointer's current root node.
- **Staleness ladder rendering** (#33 D4): fresh → quiet reconciling
  indicator → stale badge ("last synced X ago") → offline banner. Trust
  violations and withheld-update escalations render as a distinct warning
  class, never as staleness; dead-letters get a persistent, actionable
  notice. Manual refresh is a facade command with nocache semantics.
- **Sharing UI is facade commands end to end**: contact-code import (QR /
  paste, verified in the engine), grant issue/revoke/downgrade, invite links
  (the URL fragment carries the ephemeral secret; the page hands it to the
  facade unread), received-shares list from the vault share list in the
  snapshot, revocation states from the engine's
  revocation-signal/unresolvable/epoch-lag classification. The UI renders the
  engine's flag that a write link is a bearer capability.

## Login and identity

- **Web3Auth Core Kit runs on the UI thread** (it owns its DOM/redirect
  flows, MFA enrollment, and device approval — all UI-side, outside the
  engine's sight). Login or session restore exports the login secret; the
  client passes it through the facade to the engine **once**, as a
  transferred buffer, and zeroes its own copy. Everything derives in-engine
  via the KDF catalog: identity key, encryption subkey, pointer chain, vault
  entry.
- **The engine owns the token lifecycle** (#28 D5): challenge-signature login
  through its API client; access JWT in engine memory; refresh cookie rides
  the Http seam. SIWE stays secondary — wagmi collects the wallet signature
  on the UI thread and the facade forwards it (engine.md).
- **Cold start**: facade `start(secret)` → vault-pointer resolve, floor
  cold-seed, root adoption (the engine's non-circular cold-start sequence) →
  first snapshot event. The UI shows exactly two cold-start states: an
  empty-cache "loading vault" and the trust-violation error class — cached
  views otherwise render immediately (#33 D4).
- **Logout**: facade command — the engine zeroizes WASM state; the client
  tears down the worker and releases the leader lock. Floors, the op queue,
  staged bytes, and the ciphertext snapshot cache survive by design (durable
  seams, ciphertext-only); an explicit "forget this device" wipes them.

## Content paths

- **Upload**: UI hands `File` handles to the facade (transfer or Blob-clone —
  never a byte copy through React state). The engine stages into the
  StagingStore, seals chunk-wise via core, uploads through the pin-provider
  layer, and publishes — one journaled op regardless of online state (#33
  D6). Per-file progress/error is event-stream state on the upload's op id;
  cancel is a facade command killing the op before publish.
- **Download**: the engine fetches blocks (token-authed trustless gateway,
  public-gateway fallback), CID-verifies, unseals, and returns a `Blob`; the
  UI object-URLs it. Same path for previews.
- **Streaming media — the SW is a dumb pipe** (the #28 D4 open point,
  resolved): the media element requests an opaque `/stream/…` ticket URL; the
  Service Worker intercepts and forwards the Range to the engine worker over
  a `MessageChannel` port brokered at registration; the engine maps the range
  onto chunk boundaries (content is chunk-sealed with a chunk-aligned DAG —
  engine.md), fetches and unseals exactly those chunks, and streams plaintext
  back through the port. The SW holds no keys, no crypto, and no state worth
  keeping — a killed SW or broken port just re-brokers and re-buffers.
  Follower tabs route media through the leader the same way.
- **The same Service Worker precaches the app shell** (engineering judgment,
  implied by #33 D6's full offline parity): a vault you can mutate offline is
  a vault whose UI must boot offline. Cached snapshots + the op queue then
  give full offline function; the SW never caches vault data itself
  (ciphertext caching is the SnapshotCache's job).

## Composition (apps/web)

| Route | View |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Login (Core Kit methods + SIWE), recovery/approval UI |
| `/files/:nodeId?` | Vault browser (absent id = current root) |
| `/shared` | Received shares; browsing shared scopes is the same browser over the same snapshot |
| `/bin` | Recycle bin (kept per #5), restore/purge ops via facade |
| `/settings` | Auth methods, MFA/devices (Core Kit UX), BYO pinning (sealed `ByoIpfsConfig` via facade), vault settings, export |
| `/invite/:…` | Invite claim — fragment secret handed to the facade unread |

Cross-cutting chrome renders event-stream state only: sync/staleness
indicator, quota (advisory-aware for BYO), dead-letter and escalation
notices, offline banner. No route guard framework — unauthenticated pages
redirect on facade auth state, as in v1.

## Testing hooks

Structural change from v1's posture (the least-verified-layer trap): engine
logic is Rust-tested below the facade, and `packages/client` — leadership,
failover, both transports, the seams — is a **CI-blocking** browser test
surface, not an unblockable side suite. `apps/web` stays thin enough that
Playwright e2e covers it. A DEV-gated facade introspection hook (snapshot and
event-stream taps, no key access) replaces `window.__ZUSTAND_FOLDER_STORE__`
as the e2e seam. Suite shape, gating, and the leader-failover e2e scenarios
belong to the
[testing strategy](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/47).

## Open edges

- **Leader-failover UX polish** — the retry surface for commands caught
  in flight at leader death; settle alongside the failover e2e work
  ([#47](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/47)).
- **Media container edge cases** — range-to-chunk mapping is fixed above, but
  seek-heavy formats need the chunk size / DAG-shape numbers frozen with the
  engine's open edge (engine.md).
- **PWA install surface** — the app-shell precache is decided; whether v2.0
  advertises installability (manifest, install prompt) is deployment
  territory ([#48](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/48)).
- **Designed-for, deliberately unbuilt**: push overlay (API WebSocket hints)
  behind RefreshHintSource (#33 D1); client-side search re-entry feeding an
  index from the snapshot event stream (#5).
