# API residual role — v2 blueprint

Resolved by [Design: API residual role and surface](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/34).
Normative for the v2 build. Upstream inputs: the
[resolution/publish](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/23),
[record liveness](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/24),
[sharing](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/25),
[rotation](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/26), and
[schema/envelope](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/27) designs;
client and contract strategy amended by the
[component decomposition](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/28)
(D5/D6).

## Doctrine

The v2 API is a **bookkeeping and accelerator service**, not a data plane. It never
serves IPNS records on any resolve path, never sees plaintext or unencrypted keys,
and holds no state a client cannot rebuild from the network plus its own vault.
Everything it does falls into five roles: authentication, pin/name bookkeeping
(quota + republish inventory), hosted content pinning, record liveness backstop,
and an integrity-untrusted mailbox.

What left the API relative to v1 — with the design that removed it:

| Gone | Removed by |
| --- | --- |
| IPNS publish/resolve relay endpoints | #23 — clients fan out `/routing/v1` PUTs directly |
| Record serving from the DB | #23/#24 — record cache is non-canonical, no client resolve path |
| `/shares`, `share_invites` | #25 — grants live in metadata; discovery rides the mailbox |
| People directory | #34 — never built; contact codes are self-authenticating |
| All TEE endpoints, `tee_key_state`, connection-test | #24 — TEE dropped, designed-for re-signer seam only |
| Vault init/export endpoints, `vaults` table | #27 — bootstrap is the derived vault pointer; export is client-side |
| `pin_migrations` | BYO re-pin is a client-side sweep over its own pin set |
| Download streaming through the API process | #34 — reads go to the trustless gateway |
| Generated `api-client` packages and the `api:generate` codegen loop | #28 D5/D6 — one hand-written Rust client in the engine; contract enforced by live tests |

## Identity and auth

- Account = the Web3Auth-derived secp256k1 **identity key**; challenge-signature
  login; SIWE wallet login stays as a secondary auth method (feature-set decision #5).
- Short-lived access JWT + rotating refresh token (HTTP-only cookie on web,
  OS keychain on desktop). Staging-gated test-login endpoint for e2e.
- Tables: `users` (keyed by `publicKey`; carries quota-limit override and BYO flag),
  `auth_methods`, `refresh_tokens`.

## Pin/name registry

The one surface every publish flow traverses. It feeds **both** quota and the
republisher inventory; its invariant is the central v1 lesson (silent enrollment
decay) inverted into structure.

- **Endpoints**: batch register `[{ipnsName, headCid?, contentCids[]}]` and batch
  retire `[ipnsName | cid]`. Ordinary writes send single-item batches; name waves
  and sweeps send bulk. v1's BYO-only `register-cid` folds into the same register
  call.
- **Register-first, fail-closed**: registration precedes the first publish of a
  name, and publish is blocked on it. A live-but-uninventoried name is
  structurally impossible; the worst failure is a registered-never-published
  orphan, which the republisher's resolve-failure alert surfaces for GC.
- **Per-account rows, union liveness**: inventory row = `(account, ipnsName)`,
  pin row = `(account, cid, size)`. Whoever publishes registers under their own
  account — the server is zero-knowledge about the grant graph and authorizes
  nothing across accounts. The republisher walks **distinct** names; a name
  leaves the inventory when its last row is retired; physical unpin fires at
  global refcount zero (v1's `guardedUnpin` survives).
- **Shared scopes**: a write-grantee's uploads register (and count) under the
  grantee's account until the owner's client syncs, sees the new children, and
  registers them too — rows then coexist. Self-healing, permissionless.
- **Quota**: per-account sum over that account's pin rows. Hosted rows are
  authoritative and gate uploads; BYO accounts' rows are **advisory** (quota
  always allows, `advisory: true` in the quota response). Limit = env default
  plus per-account override column; no billing (out of scope).
- **Accepted exposure**: the server sees each account's flat name/CID counts,
  sizes, and churn timing — never tree structure, kinds, or names' relationships.

### Write-rotation name churn

- New names enroll automatically: the wave's publishes traverse register-first.
- Content CID rows are untouched by rotation (same CIDs re-referenced; upserts
  are idempotent). Old + new metadata head CIDs transiently double-count —
  metadata-scale only, accepted.
- **Interior fast, root lingers**: interior old names are batch-retired at wave
  completion (a resumed wave enumerates them via the write-plane history link).
  The old **scope-root** name stays registered, serving the owner-signed
  `movedTo` forwarding record, until the migration window closes — window
  length and closure signal are owned by
  [rotation completeness (#38)](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/38)
  — then retired. The API stays dumb: retire removes the caller's row; timing is
  client policy.

## Content plane

- **Provider layer, registration always** (BYO-IPFS is first-class, carried from
  v1): the client's pin-provider abstraction decides where bytes go — hosted
  (default), external (own Kubo/PSA/Pinata endpoint), or dual. Every mode's
  publish flow still traverses the registry above; only the byte path varies.
  `ByoIpfsConfig` stays sealed in vault settings; provider connection testing is
  client-side (the TEE tester is gone).
- **Ingress (hosted)**: authenticated upload endpoint, quota-gated, pins to
  CipherBox Kubo, registers pins in the same traversal. BYO/dual bytes bypass
  the API entirely.
- **Egress**: the API process serves no bytes. CipherBox runs a Kubo-backed
  **trustless gateway** (block/CAR responses, client-side CID verification)
  gated by a CipherBox auth token — an accelerator for members. Any public
  trustless gateway is the no-auth fallback; reads survive CipherBox infra loss.
  Media streaming uses ranged block/CAR fetches through the existing
  service-worker decryption layer.

## Republisher module and recovery

Per the liveness design (#24), restated here as API surface:

- In-process, worker-shaped, cleanly extractable module. Walks distinct
  inventory names on a ~12 h cadence: resolve from the network, re-PUT the same
  bytes (keyless). Alert when a name goes >24 h without a successful re-PUT.
- Non-canonical record cache table — rebuildable from the network, consulted by
  no client resolve path; refuses sequence-regressing records as
  unrelied-upon depth.
- **Recovery endpoint**: authenticated, rate-limited fetch of cached (possibly
  expired) record bytes by name — the revival aid after a >EOL lapse; a
  key-holder extracts the last CID and mints a fresh record.

## Mailbox

Integrity-untrusted, swappable transport for one-shot sealed pointers
(share pointers, write-rotation root re-points, invite claims, courtesy
notifications). Nothing on it is load-bearing for safety: root migration has
the `movedTo` record (#38), revocation is discovered in metadata.

- **Post**: any authenticated account → recipient identity pubkey; body is the
  HPKE-sealed blob (≤ ~8 KB), sender supplies an idempotency key. Posts to
  unknown recipient pubkeys are rejected — an accepted, rate-limited,
  exact-pubkey existence oracle.
- **Poll**: recipient-authenticated; returns `{id, receivedAt, blob}` — no
  sender metadata in the clear (the sealed payload is owner-signed inside).
  Clients poll on the sync design's 30 s cadence; no push in v2.0 (push-ready
  seam per #33).
- **Ack**: delete by id. Retention: until acked, bounded — per-recipient
  pending cap (reject-new when full) and a 90-day unacked TTL aligned with
  record EOLs. Rate limits per sender account and per recipient mailbox.
- **Accepted exposure**: transient `{sender, recipient, timestamp}` edges;
  never a durable graph, never key material.

## Contact exchange — no directory

There is **no people directory**. This supersedes the sharing design's
directory component (#25) and resolves crypto-review finding F-6 structurally:

- A **contact code** (QR / URL / pasted string) carries the self-authenticating
  bundle `{identityPk, encSubkey, bindingSig}` (~130 bytes). The engine verifies
  the binding signature against the carried identity key at import,
  **fail-closed and mandatory**. Invite URLs carry the owner's bundle the same
  way.
- Identity keys therefore only ever arrive out-of-band — there is no in-band
  lookup for a directory substitution attack to poison. Optional
  fingerprint-comparison UX remains available client-side for channel-MITM
  paranoia, but no server component is involved.

## Account lifecycle

- Accounts are created implicitly at first login; there is no vault-init
  endpoint — the first publish of the pointer and root rides the normal
  register-first flow.
- **Deletion: immediate hard-delete.** One authenticated call, client-confirmed;
  cascade: retire all inventory/pin rows (refcounted physical unpin), purge
  mailbox rows, delete auth rows. Sole-registered names stop being republished
  and decay from the DHT (~48 h); co-registered shared content survives via
  other accounts' rows. Nothing lingers server-side; keys still derive from the
  login secret, so a BYO self-hoster loses nothing they pin themselves.

## Contract and clients

Decomposition outcomes (#28 D5/D6), restated here as API surface:

- **The spec is server-owned.** The NestJS API keeps emitting its OpenAPI
  document from decorators, committed as a review/docs artifact. It is
  documentation, not a build input.
- **No generated clients, anywhere.** The sole first-party consumer is the
  engine's single hand-written Rust client (engine.md); v1's generated
  `api-client` packages, the `api:generate` loop, and the staged-client
  pre-commit check all die with it.
- **Enforcement is live, not lexical.** The contract is enforced by the live
  contract-test suite — the engine's client exercised against a real API
  instance in CI, the sdk-e2e descendant. Drift between server behavior and
  client expectation fails a test run, not a grep or a codegen diff. Suite
  shape and gating are owned by
  [`blueprint/testing.md`](testing.md).

## Ops

Health endpoint; Prometheus metrics; a **working** global throttler with
per-surface limits (v1's inert `@Throttle` decorators are a named defect —
rate limiting must be verified effective in e2e); staging test hooks
(test-login) gated by environment.

## Data model (complete)

`users`, `auth_methods`, `refresh_tokens`, `name_inventory (account, ipnsName)`,
`pinned_cids (account, cid, size, advisory)`, `mailbox_messages`,
`record_cache` (non-canonical). Nothing else. No crypto-bearing rows outlive
their consumer; revocation-adjacent state is hard-deleted, never soft-flagged.

## Hosted infra outside the API process

- **someguy** — self-hosted `/routing/v1` delegated routing accelerator
  (resolve + publish target; public endpoints are fallback).
- **Kubo** — pin store and the token-authed trustless gateway.

Nothing breaks if either vanishes: resolution falls back to public endpoints,
reads to public gateways, and the republisher is a liveness optimization, not a
correctness dependency.

## Open edges

- `movedTo` migration-window length and closure signal (drives when the old
  scope-root name is retired) → [#38](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/38).
- Module boundaries are fixed by
  [#28](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/28) D3 (NestJS residual
  surface + in-process, extractable republisher module); the gateway/someguy
  deployment shape →
  [deployment blueprint (#48)](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/48).
