# Desktop — v2 blueprint

Resolved by [Blueprint: desktop](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/46).
Normative for the v2 build. Upstream inputs: the
[component decomposition](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/28)
(D1/D3), the
[sync/refresh/offline](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/33)
design, the
[macOS filesystem driver research](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/32),
and the seam contracts and facade law in
[`blueprint/engine.md`](engine.md); the
[feature set](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/5) keeps the FUSE
mount as the primary desktop UX. This doc covers the two desktop-side units of
the #28 D3 layout — `apps/desktop` (Tauri shell) and `crates/fuse` (FS core +
host adapters). Where the engine blueprint already fixes behavior (adoption
gate, sync core, rotation, grants, durability), this doc adds only the
filesystem projection and native hosting around it, never a second copy of it.

## Doctrine

The desktop app is the engine's **native host**: `apps/desktop` links
`crates/engine` directly in the Tauri process and owns login, lifecycle, tray,
and updater; `crates/fuse` projects the engine's snapshot state as a mounted
filesystem and translates kernel operations into facade commands. The FS layer
is a **projection, not a second brain**: it holds no keys, no publish
machinery, no freshness policy, and no rotation logic — every trust and sync
decision already happened below the facade (engine.md). Key material lives in
engine memory only; the FS core maps inodes to stable node ids and moves
plaintext bytes, which is its job — the mount is the plaintext trust terminus
for the local OS.

What dies relative to v1 — with the design that killed it:

| Gone | Killed by |
| --- | --- |
| The desktop twin engine (`crates/sdk` rotation/sync/queue) and its TS divergence table | #28 D1 — one Rust engine, linked natively |
| Keys in the `InodeTable` (`InodeKind` read/write keys, IPNS seeds, `recipient_pins`) | engine facade — keys never cross it; the inode map is key-free |
| mkdir+uploads-only journal, `Option<()>` durability placeholder, two durability classes | #33 D6 — every mutation rides the engine's durable op queue |
| `PublishCoordinator`, debounce queue, `mutated_folders`, `apply_owned_children` merge choreography | #33 D6 — snapshot ⊕ pending-op overlay computed in the engine; the FS renders it |
| Scope-exit gate choreography in FUSE (`SentSharesCache`, pin refresh, mark-mutated, keys-after-gate ordering) | #26 D7 / engine.md — full-depth scope-exit detection and rotation are one engine transaction |
| The freshness workaround stack: dir TTL 0, edge-triggered drains, the macOS publish-pump thread | #32 — host adapters expose push invalidation, driven by the engine event stream |
| FUSE-T NFS backend and its kext-panic/no-invalidation flake class | #32 — SMB backend unconditionally |
| Whole-file 120 s content downloads before first byte | engine content plane — chunk-sealed DAG, ranged fetches |
| Per-op-type timeout zoo (3 s / 10 s / 120 s / 180 s `block_on` freezes) | never-block law below — callbacks block on local durability only |
| Duplicated operation logic per platform (`&mut self` fuser vs `Arc<Mutex>` WinFsp twin trees) | one FS operation core behind the host-adapter trait (#32) |
| TEE enrollment, device registry epochs, `tee_keys` | #24 D4 — TEE dropped |
| Plaintext temp write buffers on disk (`cb-write-*`) | sealed spill files under an ephemeral in-memory key (below) |
| Root-only 30 s `SyncDaemon` and its log-and-hope change detection | #33 D2 — FUSE-op TTL checks drive the shared sync core |
| "No offline mode" — mount unresponsive without connectivity | #33 D6 — cache-first reads + durable op queue give full offline function |

What is deliberately **kept** from v1: the fsync-barrier discipline and
ciphertext-only-at-rest law of the write journal (generalized into the engine's
StagingStore/FloorStore implementations), inode stability across renames (v1
learned reallocation causes stale-handle disconnects), platform-junk name
filtering, the vendored `fuser` MSG_PEEK patch (FUSE-T fragments >256 KB
messages; upstream accepts no PRs — the patch is load-bearing and travels with
the vendored crate, this time with a regression test), and dev-key mode as the
headless e2e seam.

## Component map

- **`apps/desktop`** — the Tauri shell: Web3Auth Core Kit webview and the
  login handoff, engine construction with the desktop seam set, mount
  lifecycle, tray + notifications, updater, deep links, autostart. No vault
  semantics; it wraps the facade and renders its event stream.
- **`crates/fuse`** — the FS core and its host adapters: the inode/handle
  model, the vfs-operation surface, read/write paths over the facade, and one
  adapter per mount technology (FUSE-T SMB, Linux FUSE, WinFsp; FSKit
  successor). Depends on the engine facade only — no direct core, transport,
  or API access.

## Engine wiring

The engine is constructed in-process at login with the desktop seam set
(engine.md table, desktop column). All engine stores live under
`<data_local_dir>/cipherbox/<accountId>/`, ciphertext-only at rest — same law
as web's IndexedDB stores; a stolen disk yields sealed bytes only.

| Seam | Desktop implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **FloorStore** | Fsync-barriered files in the engine data dir (the v1 high-water store discipline: write, `sync_all`, parent-dir fsync). Durable across logout by design |
| **RecordTransport** | `reqwest` against the configured `/routing/v1` endpoint set |
| **Http** | `reqwest`; the rotating refresh token is injected from CredentialStore |
| **Mailbox** | The engine's own API client over the Http seam — nothing desktop-specific |
| **RefreshHintSource** | FUSE-op TTL checks (below), network reconnect, tray "Sync Now", wake-from-sleep |
| **Scheduler** | Tokio — timers, background tasks, wall clock |
| **StagingStore** | The v1 write journal generalized: one durable record per op (JSON or CBOR row + fsync barrier), sidecar files for staged ciphertext, `.json`-before-`.bin` removal ordering, orphan-sidecar GC. Covers **all** mutations, not two |
| **SnapshotCache** | Sealed record/metadata cache files in the data dir; unsealed in the engine on read |
| **CredentialStore** | OS keychain (`keyring`), one service name; stores the refresh token and last-account id only — never key material |

The facade is called directly (in-process async Rust) — no RPC layer, no
worker, no tab leadership; the single-writer invariant is free on desktop
because there is exactly one engine per running app. The Tauri webview is
login-and-settings chrome only: it renders facade state forwarded over Tauri
events and never holds tokens or keys (the v1 `handle_auth_complete` handoff
survives, but the secret goes straight to `start(secret)` and is zeroized).

## The FS core and host adapters

Per the driver research (#32), the FS core's surface sits at the
**vfs-operation level, not the FUSE wire level**: one platform-neutral
operation core (lookup, getattr, readdir, open/read/write/release, create,
mkdir, unlink, rmdir, rename, statfs) implemented once, with a thin
**host-adapter trait** per mount technology. The v1 lesson is structural: the
duplicated fuser/WinFsp operation trees produced a revocation bypass (T-74-09)
that existed in exactly one of them.

The adapter trait carries, in each direction:

- **Inbound**: the vfs operations, each with platform-normalized names and
  credentials; the adapter owns wire decode, errno/NTSTATUS mapping, and
  platform quirks (readdir single-pass for FUSE-T, case-insensitive lookup on
  Windows).
- **Outbound**: an explicit **push-invalidation callback** — the FS core tells
  the adapter "this inode's data/attrs/entries changed" and the adapter maps
  it to `inval_inode`/`inval_entry` (Linux), SMB-backend invalidation (FUSE-T
  ≥ 1.2.1), WinFsp notifications, or FSKit's `DataCacheHandler`. An adapter
  that cannot invalidate (none shipping) would declare it, and the core would
  fall back to short TTLs for that mount only.

### Backends

| | macOS | Linux | Windows | macOS successor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backend | **FUSE-T ≥ 1.2.7, SMB backend** — NFS abandoned unconditionally (#32) | kernel FUSE via vendored `fuser` (MSG_PEEK patch carried) | **WinFsp** (MSI bundled) | **FSKit** module once macOS 27 is stable: Swift appex shell delegating into the shared FS core |
| Invalidation | SMB-backend invalidation (added 1.2.1) | `inval_inode`/`inval_entry` | WinFsp notify API | `FSVolume.DataCacheHandler` |
| Status | ship v2.0 | ship v2.0 | ship v2.0 | designed-for; blocked on macOS 27 + the FSKit spike |

macFUSE stays rejected (kext install friction, license, fuser ABI divergence);
File Provider stays a fallback-only note (its plaintext replica is an E2EE
regression). The hardware verification gates from #32 — SMB invalidation
round-trip, the v1 cross-client scenario, overwrite-rename atomicity, FUSE-T
commercial license terms, an FSKit beta spike — are pre-build checks owned by
the [testing strategy](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/47).

### Names and attributes

- **Uniqueness is the engine's strict comparator** (#33 D5): NFC-normalized +
  case-folded, identical on every platform, names stored as-entered. Adapter
  lookup semantics stay platform-conventional (case-sensitive presentation on
  macOS/Linux, case-insensitive on Windows), but collision behavior is decided
  by the one comparator, so every committed folder mounts everywhere.
- Platform-junk names (`.DS_Store`, `._*`, `Thumbs.db`, …) are rejected on
  create and hidden from listings on all platforms (v1 table carried forward).
  Name-length and reserved-character validation move into the operation core
  (255 bytes, platform-reserved characters rejected at create) — v1 advertised
  `namelen=255` without enforcing it.
- Inodes are allocated per mount session, stable across renames, keyed by the
  engine's stable node id; `kind` comes from the child ref (#27 D7), so
  listings never flip type.

## Reads, writes, and the never-block law

**The law**: a kernel callback may block on **local durability** (op-queue
fsync) and on **content-chunk fetches for uncached reads** — never on IPNS
resolution, publish, rotation, or any API bookkeeping call. Cache-first
resolution (#23 D5) plus the op queue (#33 D6) make everything else
asynchronous by construction; the v1 timeout zoo (3/10/120/180 s) has nothing
left to bound. The FS core is async-native on Tokio with per-op cancellation;
there is no `block_on` freeze of the whole mount behind one slow call.

- **readdir/lookup** — served from the engine snapshot (with pending-op
  overlay already applied). Never a network wait: an uncached folder renders
  from last-known-good and reconciles in the background; a truly cold folder
  (no cache) returns once the first resolve lands, the one cold-start
  exception (#33 D4).
- **read** — the engine maps the range onto sealed chunks, serves cached
  chunks immediately, fetches missing ones (gateway accelerator → public
  fallback), CID-verifies, unseals, returns plaintext. First byte no longer
  waits for the last byte. A bounded in-memory plaintext chunk cache
  (LRU, zeroized on unmount) lives in the FS core for hot-file performance —
  the one place plaintext is cached, memory-only.
- **write** — bytes land in a per-handle **sealed spill file**: XChaCha20
  under a random per-handle key held only in engine/FS memory, in the engine
  data dir. A crash leaves ciphertext whose key died with the process — the v1
  plaintext `cb-write-*` exposure class is gone (judgment; the zero-overwrite
  cleanup papers over what this closes structurally).
- **release** (and create/mkdir/rename/unlink/rmdir) — becomes exactly one
  facade intent op (`updateContent`, `create`, `rename`, `relink`, `delete`).
  The kernel is acked when the op is **journaled durably in the StagingStore**
  — the v1 INV-1 no-false-ack discipline, now uniform across every mutation
  instead of two. Everything after the ack (seal, upload, publish, CAS rebase)
  is the engine's background pipeline.
- **statfs** — quota from the engine's quota state (advisory for BYO).
  **ENOSPC becomes honest**: it returns when the offline staging budget is
  exhausted (#33 D6 fail-fast) or a hosted-quota preflight refuses the write —
  v1 never returned it at all.
- **Deletes** ride the engine's delete op; recycle-bin semantics (#5) are
  vault-level engine behavior. The bin is not projected into the mount in
  v2.0; restore/purge live in the web UI and the tray's "Open CipherBox".

### Conflicts, dead letters, and rotation

- A rebased op that loses a race follows the engine's per-op rules (#33 D5) —
  auto-suffixed add/add collisions and edit-wins deletes simply appear in the
  next snapshot; the FS core renders outcomes, it never merges.
- **Dead-letters** (terminally unrebasable ops — e.g. access revoked while
  offline) surface as a tray notification + a persistent tray section with the
  staged bytes recoverable to a local "recovered files" export; nothing is
  silently dropped and the kernel is never retro-failed (it was acked at
  journal time — the dead-letter surface is the compensation channel).
- **Scope-exit rotation** is invisible to the FS layer: a cross-scope `relink`
  or a delete from a granted scope triggers detection and rotation inside the
  engine's op pipeline (#26 D7), as one transaction with the mutation. The
  refusal path (rotation impossible, fail-closed) rejects the **op at journal
  time** — the one mutation class where the ack waits on more than the fsync:
  the engine must accept the op before the kernel hears success. EIO with a
  tray explanation; v1's four-workaround gate choreography has no v2 home.

## Freshness — the desktop trigger source

Desktop drives the **same sync core** as web, from FUSE traffic instead of
navigation (#33 D2):

- Every lookup/readdir/getattr checks the target's snapshot age against the
  sync timing profile's staleness threshold; a stale hit fires a refresh hint
  for that node — this is the **FUSE-op TTL check**, the desktop analog of
  route navigation.
- The **focus window** is derived from the op stream: folders with FUSE
  traffic inside the profile's focus horizon count as "open", and the 30 s
  tick refreshes them plus their ancestor chains and the vault pointer —
  Finder windows behave like browser tabs. Everything else refreshes on
  access.
- When a background reconcile lands a new snapshot, the engine event stream
  drives the **push-invalidation callback**, and the kernel's next access
  re-reads through the adapter — replacing dir-TTL-0, drain choreography, and
  the pump thread. Kernel entry/attr TTLs are set from the sync timing
  profile per backend capability, not hardcoded zeros.
- The FUSE-T SMB cache remains a platform ceiling: invalidation now works
  (≥ 1.2.1), but its actual cross-client latency is a hardware-verify item
  (#32 → #47), and the FSKit successor is the structural fix.

## Tauri shell

- **Login**: Web3Auth Core Kit in the webview (its DOM/redirect flows, MFA,
  device approval — all chrome-side); the exported secret crosses to
  `start(secret)` once and is zeroized. Challenge-signature login, token
  refresh, and session restore are engine-native (engine.md API client);
  the shell's only credential duty is hosting the keychain seam. Dev-key mode
  survives: a debug flag feeds the staging test-login path through the same
  facade, keychain bypassed — the headless agent/e2e seam.
- **Tray** renders the event stream: the staleness ladder maps to
  `Synced / Reconciling / Stale / Offline`, dead-letters to the parked-writes
  state (edge-triggered notifications, v1's anti-spam watermark kept), trust
  violations and withheld-update escalations to a distinct warning state that
  is never conflated with staleness (#33 D4). "Sync Now" is a manual-refresh
  facade command with nocache semantics.
- **Lifecycle**: menu-bar app; mount failure never fails login (session stays
  up, tray shows the error); logout = facade logout (engine zeroizes),
  unmount, keychain token delete; the durable stores survive logout by design
  and an explicit "forget this device" wipes them — same law as web.
  Unmount/quit ordering: quiesce the adapter (stop accepting kernel ops),
  unmount, then stop the engine — acked-but-unpublished ops are already
  journaled and drain on next mount.
- **Replay on mount** is the engine's op-queue drain — the FS core has no
  replay logic of its own (v1's `replay.rs` key-recovery machinery dies with
  the journal it served). Mount renders from SnapshotCache immediately;
  prepopulation is just the focus-window warming on first traffic.
- **Updater**: Tauri updater over GitHub releases, minisign-verified —
  carried from v1; release mechanics belong to
  [deployment/release management](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/48).

## Testing hooks

The FS operation core is unit-testable without a kernel: the host-adapter
trait means tests drive vfs operations directly against an engine with mock
seams (the v1 Windows tree that "only CI can compile" shrinks to a thin
adapter). Cross-platform e2e (mount, mutate, cross-client sync, offline
replay, rotation-under-mount) and the #32 hardware gates are owned by the
[testing strategy](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/47);
WinFsp CI remains authoritative for the Windows adapter, and dev-key mode is
the headless harness entry.

## Open edges

- **FSKit spike** — run against the macOS 27 beta before committing the
  successor timeline; the adapter trait is shaped for it, but
  `mountSingleVolume`/`DataCacheHandler` behavior needs hands-on confirmation
  (#32 verify list, → [#47](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/47)).
- **FUSE-T license terms** for commercial bundling — verify before v2.0 ships
  (#32).
- **Dead-letter recovery UX** — the tray surface and "recovered files" export
  shape; settle alongside the failover/offline e2e work
  ([#47](https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box-next/issues/47)).
- **Focus-horizon value** — how long FUSE traffic keeps a folder "open" joins
  the sync timing profile.
- **Kernel TTL values per backend** — profile constants, frozen with the #47
  cross-client latency measurements.
- **Designed-for, deliberately unbuilt**: FSKit adapter (above); desktop
  embedded DHT behind RecordTransport (#23 D2); desktop PubSub push behind
  RefreshHintSource (#33 D1).
