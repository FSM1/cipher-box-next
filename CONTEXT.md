# CipherBox v2 — Ubiquitous Language

Glossary only. Implementation detail lives in `specs/`; decisions in issue resolutions and `docs/adr/`.

## Read-plane key model (seeded derivation)

- **Node seed** — the per-node secret from which a node's keys derive, flat within a scope: `nodeSeed(X) = KDF(scopeSeed, X.id)`. Location-independent, so intra-scope moves are pure relinks; membership is the envelope's epoch tag.
- **Scope** — a derivation domain: the set of nodes keyed from one random scope seed. The vault root is the initial scope; every grant on an interior folder and every rotation creates or re-seeds one.
- **Scope root** — the node a scope is anchored at, carrying its grant blobs, owner blob, ascent link, and history links. Granting an interior folder makes it a scope root (with a subtree sweep into the new scope).
- **Content key** — a random per-version key stored inline in the sealed read-body. Rotation re-wraps it for free via the metadata re-seal and never re-encrypts content bytes; the next version is fresh-keyed. There is no pending-re-key state.
- **Cross-scope move** — moving a node between scopes re-seals the moved subtree at the destination scope's epoch (and is a scope exit for the source when the source is granted).
- **Override seed** — the fresh random seed minted at a scope root by a rotation, replacing its derived (or prior override) seed and starting a new epoch.
- **Epoch** — a scope-relative rotation counter. Every sealed body carries a plaintext, AAD-bound **epoch tag** `{scope, epoch}`.
- **Ascent link** — the current override seed sealed to an asymmetric keypair derived from the *parent's* node seed (never the child's own): the public half rides plaintext in the scope root's envelope so any writer can re-seal the link; unsealing requires the parent seed, so only ancestor-scope readers descend. Ancestor readers re-derive the expected keypair and reject a mismatched public half. Deliberately unreadable to holders of the scope's own prior seed.
- **Owner blob** — the current override seed ECIES-wrapped to the vault owner's identity key, present at every scope root and maintained by whoever rotates. The owner is an implicit, permanent, unrevokable grantee of every scope. An accelerator for owner entry — the canonical path is the owner seed cache; cross-checked against the ascent link and actual unseals, with disagreement raised as attributable abuse.
- **Owner seed cache** — the owner's self-authored `{seed, epoch}` per granted scope, kept in the owner's own vault share list and refreshed on every confirmed owner read. The canonical owner entry into any scope; a rogue rotator can withhold at most the epochs minted since the owner's last visit.
- **History link** — the previous epoch's seed sealed under the current one; the key-regression ratchet. Current-seed holders walk backward to read not-yet-resealed nodes; old-seed holders can never walk forward.
- **Lazy wave** — post-rotation re-sealing of a scope's descendants at the new epoch, carried by ordinary writes and/or a background sweep rather than an eager cascade.
- **Epoch lag** — a node whose envelope epoch is behind its scope's current epoch; readable via history links, queued for the lazy wave. Replaces v1's "dirty edge".
- **Eager set** — the nodes a rotation must republish before it counts as cut: the rotated scope root plus every descendant scope root carrying a live grant. Interior nodes ride the lazy wave.
- **Epoch-converged** — a subtree with no epoch-lagged nodes. Granting a subtree requires converging it first (a new grantee cannot regress through an ancestor scope's history).

## Write-plane key model

- **Write seed** — the write plane's parallel derivation, flat within a write scope: `writeSeed(X) = KDF(writeScopeSeed, X.id)`. A node's Ed25519 IPNS keypair, its `ipnsName`, and its `writeKey` all derive from its write seed. Read grants carry read seeds only; write grants carry both.
- **Write-scope cut** — granting write on an interior folder anchors a fresh write scope there: flat derivation means one node's write seed cannot derive its children's, so the grant mints a write scope seed and runs a name wave over the subtree.
- **Name wave** — the background, child-first republish of a write-rotated scope under freshly derived names, root re-pointed last. Survivor write-grantees derive new names locally; read-only survivors follow republished mirrors (root via mailbox re-point).
- **Forgery window** — accepted residual: during the name wave a revoked writer can still seal plausible old-epoch records at not-yet-rotated old names. Bounded by wave duration; old names retire from the republisher inventory (tombstones advisory only).

## Envelope and grants

- **Envelope** — the published plaintext wrapper of a node: format version, node id, epoch tag, the sealed bodies, and (at scope roots only) the grant section. Kind-uniform: whether a node is a file or a folder is sealed inside the read-body.
- **Write-body** — the sealed write-plane payload, present only at scope roots: the grant ledger plus the write-plane history link. Interior nodes publish none; all their write material is derived.
- **Blinded tag** — the opaque per-pair label a grant blob is keyed by, derived from an owner–recipient shared secret and the scope root's name. Observers learn only blob count; the recipient self-locates their blob.
- **Grant blob** — a scope's current seed(s) sealed to one recipient and keyed by their blinded tag, carried in the scope root's envelope. Read grants carry the read seed; write grants carry both seeds.
- **Grant ledger** — the authoritative record of a scope's grants, `(recipient, permission, tag)`, sealed in the scope root's write-body. Writers re-wrap blobs for the recorded set during re-seals but cannot change the set; grant changes are owner-only.
- **Grant-set commitment** — the owner-signed `(tag, permission, pseudonymPk)` list in the scope root's envelope, plus the owner's own pseudonym key. Recipients verify their tag is committed before trusting a grant. Binds tag membership and writer pseudonyms only — never blob contents. Deliberately epoch-free, so grantee-triggered rotation needs no owner signature.
- **Writer pseudonym** — the per-(scope, writer) signing keypair derived from the same pairwise ECDH secret as the blinded tag; its public key rides the grant-set commitment. Any envelope holder verifies committed-write authorship; only ledger readers map a pseudonym to an identity; observers see nothing linkable across scopes.
- **Structure signature** — the rotator's detached pseudonym signature over a seed-bearing structure's ciphertext and context `{scope, epoch, structure tag, recipient tag}`, carried by grant blobs, the owner blob, ascent and history links, and the write-body. A missing or invalid signature is a whole-record trust violation at the adoption gate.
- **Encryption subkey** — the sealing key each user derives from their login secret, published signed by their identity key. The identity key only signs; the subkey only seals.
- **Scope pointer** — the owner-keyed stable IPNS name every shared scope carries, `pointerKey(scope) = KDF(ownerPointerSeed, scope.id)`. Its record holds the re-point object; consulted on the sync tick for open shared scopes, on access for cached ones, and first on cold start.
- **Re-point object** — the owner-identity-signed `{scopeId, currentRootName, writeEpoch, minReadEpoch, prevRootName}` payload, published at the scope pointer (canonical) and mirrored to the mailbox and the old name's tombstone as accelerators. The cold-start floor anchor: `minReadEpoch` is bumped only by owner-triggered read rotations, so grantee rotations need no owner signature yet revocation boundaries cannot be rolled back.
- **Floor law** — floors advance only on an AAD-confirmed unseal and cold-seed from the re-point object's owner-vouched epochs, never from a raw blob field; a grant blob's epoch field is an advisory routing hint.
- **Vault pointer** — the indexed IPNS name chain derived from the owner's login secret, `pointerKey_i = KDF(secret, "vault-pointer" ‖ i)`, index 0 default; its record carries the root scope's re-point object. The cold-boot entry point; root write rotation re-points it. Clients probe one index past the highest known and adopt the highest valid owner-signed payload; an owner-side index bump is the pointer-key-compromise recovery.

## Sync and refresh

- **Sync timing profile** — the environment-scoped bundle of sync timing policy: record TTL, poll cadence, staleness thresholds, offline staging budget, escalation window. Records always set TTL explicitly; TTL is independent of EOL.
- **Focus window** — the set a poll tick refreshes: the vault pointer, the open folder, and its ancestor chain to root. Everything else refreshes on access.
- **Pending-op overlay** — the client state law: rendered state is the last-known-good remote snapshot with queued ops applied on top; the op queue is the only local divergence.
- **Op queue** — the durable FIFO journal of intent ops every mutation rides. Offline replay and online CAS rebase re-apply ops through the same path.
- **Adoption gate** — the trust pipeline every resolved record passes before adoption: signature verify, commitment verify, structure signatures against committed write pseudonyms (scope roots), strictly-newer sequence vs floor, epoch at or above the scope floor, unseal success. A failure is a fail-closed trust violation, never mere staleness.
- **Conditional delete** — a delete op snapshots its target's own record sequence; on rebase it is dropped if the target advanced. Edit wins in both directions: a rebased edit resurrects a concurrently deleted node.
- **Observed repair** — cleanup of an invariant violation noticed at read time by any write-capable client, e.g. removing the losing link of a dual-linked child.
- **Dual-link** — one child linked in two parents, the benign crash residue of a dest-first move; repaired deterministically via the child ref's monotonic link counter.
- **Dead-letter** — a queued op that terminally fails rebase, surfaced to the user with any staged content preserved rather than silently dropped.
- **Withheld-update escalation** — the shared-scope warning raised when a name stays pinned past a profile window while other resolves succeed; the reader-side signal for a stale-view pin.

## API residual surface

- **Name inventory** — the per-account `(account, ipnsName)` registry feeding the republisher. Membership derives from pin registration on the publish path, never from a side-channel.
- **Register-first** — the fail-closed ordering law: a name/CID batch registers before its first publish, and publish blocks on it. Live-but-uninventoried is structurally impossible; the residual failure is a registered-never-published orphan, alert-GC'd.
- **Union liveness** — a name stays in the republish inventory while any account holds a row for it; it leaves when the last row retires. Physical unpin fires at global refcount zero.
- **Advisory pin row** — a BYO account's registration: counted for union liveness and the inventory, never quota-enforced; the bytes live on the user's own provider.
- **Root linger** — after a write rotation, the old scope-root name stays registered serving the owner-signed `movedTo` record until the migration window closes; interior old names retire at wave completion.
- **Read accelerator** — CipherBox's token-authed Kubo trustless gateway. A member convenience on the read path; any public trustless gateway is the no-auth fallback.
- **Recovery endpoint** — authenticated fetch of non-canonical cached record bytes by name; the revival aid after a >EOL liveness lapse, on no client resolve path.
- **Contact code** — the self-authenticating bundle `{identityPk, encSubkey, bindingSig}` exchanged out-of-band (QR/URL); binding verification at import is mandatory and fail-closed. Replaces any people directory.
- **Mailbox** — the API's integrity-untrusted sealed-pointer transport: post to a recipient pubkey, poll, ack-deletes; bounded until-acked retention. Every payload is sender-identity-signed inside the seal, verified against the contact-code-anchored key; unauthenticated items are dropped. Carries discovery and courtesy traffic only, nothing load-bearing for safety.
